# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),

## [0.23.0] - WIP

### Changed

- Breaking change of WebSockets API (`ActionStateBefore` event).
- Switched to Python 3.9, updated dependencies.

## [0.22.1] - 2021-10-26

### Changed

- Added HTTP upload server for logs from AREditor
  - Logs are uploaded to /root/logs (could be changed using ARCOR2_AREDITOR_LOGS_FOLDER env variable)

## [0.22.0] - 2021-10-25

### Changed

- When getting pose/joints from a robot fails, continue trying instead of giving up.
- Handle `KinematicsException` to deliver a more precise error message.
- Updating object models.
  - New RPC `UpdateObjectModel`.
  - Ability to lock individual ObjectTypes.
  - Various improvements regarding locking.
- Proper handling of scene/project problems.
  - Any problem makes scene/project invalid, and then it can't be opened.  
  - Scene/project problems are now checked when:
    - Scene/project is listed.
    - Opening a scene/project is requested.
  - Found problems are cached for better performance.
  - ObjectTypes are checked for changes during each listing of scenes/projects.
- Deleting ObjectTypes reworked.
  - `DeleteObjectType` replaced with `DeleteObjectTypes`.
  - The new RPC takes list of ObjectType IDs.
  - Empty list means all ObjectTypes.
  - It returns list of id/error for types that could not be removed.
  - This is especially useful for usage with `dry_run`.
- Updated environment variables, please see README.
- Improved logging to debug 'Locking failed'.
- Support for virtual collision objects.
  - `AddVirtualCollisionObjectToScene` RPC creates a new OT and adds its instance to a scene.
  - In the simplest case, each collision object will have its own ObjectType.
  - But it is also possible to add more instances as with other types.
  - When the last instance of VCO is removed, ARServer also removes the ObjectType automatically.
- Ignoring `hidden` actions (a new flag in `ActionMetadata`).
- New RPC `ObjectTypeUsage` returning scene ids where the ObjectType is used.
- Support for debugging - relaying related RPCs to the Execution Service.
- Better handling of exceptions in asyncio tasks.
  - More useful traceback is printed out.
  - In development mode, an unhandled exception leads to shutdown of a service.
  - In production mode, traceback is printed out and the service tries to continue.

### Fixed

- Ban HT mode changes while moving.
- Arguments for getting robot joints (only affected multi-arm robots).
- Handle locking exceptions on scene start/stop.
- Copying of action points.
  - Fixed locking within `CopyActionPoint`.
  - Fixed update of orientation IDs.
- Added locking to Project client to make the cache caching properly.
- `modified`  was missing for disabled object.
  - This happened when it was not possible to get object's base.
- Copy AP - update of orientation ID in actions.
- Removed 'delayed' unlocking of resources which caused race conditions in some cases and made the crashes hard to debug.
- HT mode for single arm robots was broken.


## [0.21.0] - 2021-08-05

### Changed

- Locks are not automatically released when aiming is done or cancelled.
- Linear movements are used by default for stepping and table alignment.
- Joints stream (`RobotJoints` event) now contains also gripper joints when available (depends on the particular ObjectType).

### Fixed

- Getting action results (the result was always `False`).
- `ctx_read_lock` made some RPCs impossible to success.
- Object parameters checking.
  - Values and types of object parameters were not checked at all.
  - For now, only basic types are supported.

## [0.20.0] - 2021-07-29

### Changed

- Support for multi arm robots.
  - Dealing with `arm_id` parameter in RPCs.
  - Streaming EEF poses for all arms.
- Allow to reposition scene objects while online.
  - It was allowed to reposition objects using robot,
  - ...but disallowed to do it manually.
  - This was inconsistent and unnecessarily restrictive.
  - Now objects (except robots) can be repositioned anytime.
- When creating a new project, common parameters are added automatically.
  - At the moment those are `scene_id` and `project_id`.
  - A user could use or remove them.
- Collisions are not removed after stopping the scene.
- ObjectType change detection is now based on `modified` instead of comparing source codes.
- ARServer Project service client now stores cached scenes/projects.
- Object aiming reworked.
  - RPCs were renamed and all of them now have `dry_run`.
  - There is a new method to cancel the process.
  - One user can be aiming one object at the moment.
  - Both the object and the selected robot have to be write-locked.
  - Improved logging.
  - Test was added.
- Server no longer downloads URDF packages.
  - `ARCOR2_DATA_PATH` environment variable is no longer used.
  - Clients will get URDFs through reverse proxy from Project service.
- `NewObjectType` no longer assumes that mesh already exists.
  - A file associated to mesh must exist in advance.
  
  
### Fixed
- All calls to the Scene service are guarded against exceptions.
- Renaming of project parameters fixed.
  - It was possible to use already taken name.

## [0.19.0] - 2021-06-22

- Update to API version 0.15.0.

## [0.18.0] - 2021-06-11

### Changed

- Updated to work with Project service 0.8.0.
- Allow fast re-login after connection was broken.
- Added locking to const-related RPCs.
- Log calibration-related errors.

### Fixed

- Handle invalid ObjectType settings annotation.

## [0.17.0] - 2021-05-21

### Changed

- Return value of `GetCameraPose` RPC updated.
- Objects initialization order.
  - Object initialization order can be set using class-level `INIT_PRIORITY` variable.
  - The higher priority, the sooner are objects of that type initialized.
  - Initialization happens in parallel (for objects of the same priority).
- `SetEefPerpendicularToWorld` now calls IK in parallel.
  - This provides almost 100% speed-up even when the robot service proceeds requests one by one.
- Added locking of internal resources.
  - Created a lock module that allows to read/write lock existing or special objects. The module contains:
    - lock object with all necessary methods;
    - structures for keeping data about locked objects;
    - locking-related exceptions;
    - queue and task for notifying UI about lock data;
    - methods for auto-unlocking after timeout when user logouts.
  - Base tests of locking structure.
  - RPCs for (un)locking object, registering user name.
  - Events for (un)locking object.
  - Created a class for maintaining connected UIs.
  - Project methods to get object by ID, object parent and object children.
  
  - All RPCs that requires some kind of locking are now lock-guarded.
  - Updated existing tests to work with newly implemented locking.
  - Global variables `SCENE`, `PROJECT` and `INTERFACES` moved to new classes.
- Rewritten cache for the Project service.
  - The cache is now always on (provides a significant speed-up).
  - External updates to the Project service are recognized properly.
- New RPC `AddApUsingRobot`.
- Support for multiple inheritance.
    - ObjectTypes can now use mixins.
    - It should be used like `class NewObjectType(MixinA, MixinB, Generic)`.
    - E.g. the last ancestor should be something derived from `Generic`.
- `SetEefPerpendicularToWorld` faster as it calls IK in parallel. 

### Fixed

- `SceneState` event was not sent to a newly connected UIs.
- Results of actions are now forgotten when going offline.
- Fixed support for `link` parameter type.

## [0.16.0] - 2021-04-20

### Fixed
- Action can't use its own result as a parameter (link parameter type).

### Changed
- Dependency on arcor2 0.15.0 with updated REST client.
- Action parameter value is now always JSON.
  - It used to be a string for link/constant special types.

- Robot-related API (MoveToPose, MoveToJoints, MoveToActionPoint) updated in order to contain `safe` parameter.
- API to enable/disable robot hand teaching mode.  
- Concrete and helpful error messages when a name entered by the user is refused.

### Fixed
- Only `BareActionPoint` was sent on parent change.

## [0.12.0] - 2021-02-08
